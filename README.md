# AgriToken
AgriToken project is a blockchain-based system designed to digitize and tokenize agricultural assets. Its main idea is to represent crops, livestock, or farm produce as digital tokens on a blockchain, allowing farmers, buyers, and investors to trade, track, and verify ownership securely.

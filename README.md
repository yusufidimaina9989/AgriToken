# AgriToken
AgriToken project is a blockchain-based system designed to digitize and tokenize agricultural assets. Its main idea is to represent crops, livestock, or farm produce as digital tokens on Hedera Ledger Technology, allowing farmers, buyers, and investors to trade, track, and verify ownership securely.
